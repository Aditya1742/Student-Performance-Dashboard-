# Student-Performance-Dashboard-
Data Cleaning, Visualization, and Grading

This project analyzes the academic performance of students across multiple subjects, including Math, Science, English, History, and Computer Science. The goal is to compute total and average scores for each student, assign grades, and visualize the data to derive insights.
